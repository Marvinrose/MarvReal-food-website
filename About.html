      <p class="text-center">
        In 2015, Fran Lively enjoyed dining at the then 15-month old Via Reál.
        Upon learning it was to close, she purchased the restaurant, and in the
        ensuing years she instilled a gracious and sincere love for serving
        others. Since then, Via Reál has grown into a beautiful, successful Las
        Colinas establishment known nationwide for its relaxed Santa Fe style
        and delicious Mexican and Southwestern cuisine.
